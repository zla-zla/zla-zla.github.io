<h2>Demos for <i>&quot;High-capacity Generative Image Steganography Approach for Hiding Multiple Secret Images;</i>.</h2>
<p>Authors: Xiyao Liu, Li'an Zhong, Xiangui Kang, Gerald Schaefer, Da Huang, Ziping Ma</a></p>
<p>Abstract: Current high-capacity image steganography methods face challenges in balancing hidden capacity, imperceptibility, and recovery quality. While embedding-based approaches enable full-image hiding, they tend to produce detectable artifacts under high payloads, whereas existing generative methods struggle to conceal full-sized secret images and often generate unrealistic stego images. This paper proposes a novel generative steganography approach to address these dilemmas, securely hiding four full-sized secret images into a single realistic stego image while maintaining security. Our key innovations include: (1) a meticulously designed autoencoder to compress and inject secret images into the shallow layer of the generator; (2) a three-stage optimization strategy for stable training; and (3) an automatic image selection procedure to enhance security. Experimental results demonstrate that when hiding four images, our method achieves a PSNR of 30.45 dB between secret and reconstructed images, while maintaining a steganalysis accuracy of 50% (equivalent to random guessing), significantly outperforming existing embedding-based methods in security. Compared to existing generative approaches, our method achieves higher hidden capacity while preserving superior visual quality of stego-images, with a FID of 6.97, surpassing the suboptimal method's FID of 22.72. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative image steganography to achieve four image hiding without compromising realism or security, addressing limitations in both embedding and generative paradigms.</p>
